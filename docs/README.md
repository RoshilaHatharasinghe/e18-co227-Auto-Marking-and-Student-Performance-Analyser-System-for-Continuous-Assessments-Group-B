## Introduction

 The Department of Computer Engineering uses many coding-based assignments for the continuous assessment of student learning. The instructors have to spend a lot of time manually marking these assignments which is not the ideal use of the instructorsâ€™ time. Under the current system, instructors have to manually go through each student's code to evaluate their performance.  As a result, Instructors have less time to spend on other student activities such as teaching.

Most coding assignments these days can be evaluated relatively well by using an Auto Grader. By giving a diverse set of test cases, codes written by a student can be evaluated well. 

So the motivation of this project is to create an Autograder which is capable of evaluating coding assignments submitted by students.

## Other Sub Topics

### Proposed Solution

Our solution to the problem is to integrate an already existing Auto-Grading system into a web interface that allows to track the students' performances.
